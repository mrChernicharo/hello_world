# hello_world



Hello world! My name is Felipe, but you can call me Chern, or Cherny

I'm a Brazillian Dev and Musician. I love to study and I'm allways up to learn something new

The technologies I've been studying the most lately are NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native but I have a nice Python and PHP background as well
